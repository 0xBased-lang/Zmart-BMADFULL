### Tracking Documents
- **bmm-workflow-status.md** - SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH
  - Always check this FIRST
  - Always update this LAST
  - Never deviate from what it says

### Process Documents
- **CLAUDE.md** - AI enforcement rules (MANDATORY reading)
- **DAILY_BMAD_CHECKLIST.md** - Daily compliance validation

## 🎓 BMAD METHODOLOGY PRINCIPLES

### Core Concepts:

1. **Story-First Development**
   - Every feature is a story
   - Story defines what to build
   - No code without story

2. **One Story At A Time**
   - Never work in parallel
   - Complete fully before next
   - Track progress accurately

3. **Workflow Status Is Truth**
   - Check it first, update it last
   - Single source of truth
   - Never deviate

4. **Documentation Is Non-Negotiable**
   - Every story gets completion doc
   - Every epic gets retrospective
   - Architecture stays current

5. **Process Over Speed**
   - Following process IS fast
   - Cutting corners creates debt
   - Trust the process

---

## 🚨 ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY

**Deviations from BMAD methodology are NOT ACCEPTABLE.**

**Previous deviation:** Lost 20+ hours, 45% compliance, broken process
**Current tolerance:** ZERO
**Commitment:** 100% compliance from here forward

**If deviation detected:**
1. STOP all work immediately
2. Document the deviation
3. Fix the deviation
4. Realign with BMAD
5. Commit to not repeating

**We will NOT repeat previous mistakes.**

---

## 💡 WHY THIS APPROACH?

### The Previous Deviation Taught Us:

1. **Discipline Alone Isn't Enough**
   - Need enforcement mechanisms
   - Need validation checkpoints
   - Need regular audits

2. **Success Can Breed Complacency**
   - Epic 1 success → overconfidence
   - Dropped discipline after initial success
   - Assumed process was "internalized"

3. **Workflow Status Is Critical**
   - Ignoring it broke everything
   - Must be checked first, updated last
   - Is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

4. **AI Assistant Must Enforce**
   - Claude must validate compliance
   - Claude must refuse non-compliant work
   - Claude must check workflow status

### The Solution:

- **CLAUDE.md:** Programming AI as enforcer
- **DAILY_BMAD_CHECKLIST.md:** Daily validation
- **Workflow status:** Single source of truth
- **Zero tolerance:** No exceptions allowed

## 📞 NEED HELP?

### Decision Tree:

```
Can I start working?
├─ Read workflow status? → NO → Read it first
├─ Story file exists? → NO → Create story file
├─ Working on current story? → NO → STOP, realign
├─ Previous work committed? → NO → Commit first
└─ All yes? → START WORK ✅
```

### Common Questions:

**Q: Can I work on multiple stories at once?**
A: NO. One story at a time. Complete fully before next.

**Q: Can I skip documentation if I'm in a hurry?**
A: NO. Documentation is non-negotiable.

**Q: Can I build a feature not in epics.md?**
A: NO. Update epics.md first, create story, then implement.

**Q: What if story workflow feels awkward?**
A: Follow it anyway. Adapt story type if needed, but TRACK it.

**Q: Can I check workflow status weekly instead of daily?**
A: NO. Check EVERY MORNING before work.
