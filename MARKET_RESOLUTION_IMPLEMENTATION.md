## 🔐 Smart Contract Security

### **Resolution Security (resolve_market)**

1. **Authorization Checks:**
   - Only market creator can resolve
   - Platform wallet must match global parameters
   - Market must be Active (not already resolved)

2. **Timing Validation:**
   - Cannot resolve before end_date
   - Validates current timestamp ≥ end_date

3. **Fee Distribution:**
   - Platform fees transferred to platform wallet
   - Creator fees transferred to creator wallet
   - Fees removed from market PDA before user claims

### **Claim Security (claim_payout)**

1. **Eligibility Checks:**
   - Market must be Resolved
   - User must have bet on winning side
   - Cannot claim if already claimed

2. **Reentrancy Protection:**
   - Mark `claimed = true` BEFORE transfer
   - Update `total_claimed` BEFORE transfer
   - Prevents double-claiming attacks

3. **Overflow Protection:**
   - Uses u128 for payout calculations
   - Checked arithmetic prevents overflows
   - Caps payout to remaining pool

4. **Payout Formula:**
   ```rust
   share_of_winnings = (user_bet × losing_pool) / winning_pool
   payout = user_bet + share_of_winnings
   ```

## 🧪 Testing Guide

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Complete Market Creation first:**
   - Follow `MARKET_CREATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md`
   - Have at least one active market with bets

2. **Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   # Add to .env.local
   NEXT_PUBLIC_PLATFORM_WALLET=your_platform_wallet_address
   ```

3. **Wallet Setup:**
   - Market creator wallet (to resolve)
   - User wallet (to claim winnings)
   - Both funded with devnet SOL

### **Test Scenario 1: Market Resolution (Happy Path)**

**Steps:**
1. Navigate to `/admin` as market creator
2. Find a market that has ended (past end_date)
3. Ensure market has bets on both YES and NO sides
4. Click "✓ Resolve YES" or "✗ Resolve NO"
5. Approve transaction in wallet

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Toast shows: "Step 1/2: Resolving market on-chain..."
- ✅ Toast shows: "Step 2/2: Syncing resolution to database..."
- ✅ Toast shows: "🎉 Market resolved as [OUTCOME]! Users can now claim payouts."
- ✅ Console logs show resolution tx hash
- ✅ Market status changes to "Resolved" in database
- ✅ Platform fees transferred to platform wallet
- ✅ Creator fees transferred to creator wallet

**Console Logs to Verify:**
```
🎯 Starting market resolution: [market_id] → [OUTCOME]
📊 Resolving market: { marketId: X, outcome: 'YES', ... }
📡 Transaction sent: [tx_hash]
✅ Market resolved successfully! Tx: [tx_hash]
✅ Resolution Tx: [tx_hash]
✅ Market synced to database
```

**On-Chain Verification:**
1. Check transaction on Solana Explorer (devnet)
2. Verify `MarketResolvedEvent` was emitted
3. Verify platform_fees and creator_fees transfers
4. Check market PDA: status = Resolved, resolved_outcome set

### **Test Scenario 2: Claim Winnings (Happy Path)**

**Setup:**
1. Resolve a market where you placed a winning bet
2. Navigate to homepage or user dashboard
3. Add ClaimWinnings component to page:
   ```tsx
   import { ClaimWinnings } from '@/app/components/ClaimWinnings'

   // In your page component:
   <ClaimWinnings />
   ```

**Steps:**
1. Connect wallet that placed winning bet
2. View ClaimWinnings component
3. Verify expected payout is displayed correctly
4. Click "💰 Claim [amount] SOL"
5. Approve transaction in wallet

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Toast shows: "Claiming your winnings..."
- ✅ Toast shows: "🎉 Claimed [amount] SOL!"
- ✅ Console logs show claim tx hash
- ✅ SOL transferred to user wallet
- ✅ Bet marked as claimed in database
- ✅ Bet removed from claimable list

**Payout Calculation Verification:**
```
Given:
- User bet 1 SOL on YES
- YES pool total: 10 SOL
- NO pool total: 5 SOL
- Market resolved YES

Calculation:
- share_of_winnings = (1 × 5) / 10 = 0.5 SOL
- payout = 1 + 0.5 = 1.5 SOL

Expected: User receives 1.5 SOL (1 SOL original + 0.5 SOL profit)
```

### **Test Scenario 3: Cannot Resolve Before End Date**

**Steps:**
1. Try to resolve a market that hasn't ended yet
2. Attempt resolution

**Expected Results:**
- ❌ Toast shows: "Market has not ended yet. Cannot resolve before end date."
- ❌ No on-chain transaction sent
- ❌ No database changes

### **Test Scenario 4: Cannot Claim if Bet Lost**

**Steps:**
1. Bet YES on a market
2. Resolve market as NO
3. Try to claim payout

**Expected Results:**
- ❌ Bet does not appear in ClaimWinnings component
- ❌ If manually attempted: "You bet on the losing side. No payout available."

### **Test Scenario 5: Cannot Claim Twice**

**Steps:**
1. Claim payout successfully
2. Try to claim again

**Expected Results:**
- ❌ Bet no longer appears in ClaimWinnings component
- ❌ If manually attempted: "You have already claimed your payout"

### **Test Scenario 6: Payout Calculation Edge Cases**

**Test Case 6a: All Bets on Winning Side**
```
Setup:
- 10 users bet YES (10 SOL total)
- 0 users bet NO (0 SOL)
- Market resolves YES

Expected:
- Each user gets original bet back (no profit from losing pool)
- Payout = bet + (bet × 0 / 10) = bet
```

**Test Case 6b: Lopsided Pool**
```
Setup:
- 1 user bets YES (1 SOL)
- 10 users bet NO (10 SOL total)
- Market resolves YES

Expected:
- Single YES bettor gets massive payout
- Payout = 1 + (1 × 10 / 1) = 11 SOL (10x profit!)
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **Problem: "Market has not ended yet" error**

**Solution:**
- Check `end_date` in markets table
- Ensure current time > end_date
- Verify timezone is correct (UTC)
- Update end_date if needed for testing

### **Problem: "Unauthorized: Only market creator can resolve"**

**Solution:**
- Verify connected wallet matches market creator
- Check `creator_wallet` field in markets table
- Use correct admin wallet for resolution

### **Problem: "Market has already been resolved"**

**Solution:**
- Check market status in database
- If status = 'resolved', market was already resolved
- View resolved_outcome to see previous resolution
- Cannot re-resolve markets

### **Problem: Expected payout doesn't match calculation**

**Solution:**
- Verify pool sizes in database (yes_pool, no_pool)
- Check bet amount (use amount_to_pool, not total amount)
- Fees already deducted from amount_to_pool
- Use formula: `payout = amount_to_pool + (amount_to_pool × losing_pool / winning_pool)`

### **Problem: Claim transaction fails with "BetLost"**

**Solution:**
- User bet on losing side
- Verify bet_side vs resolved_outcome
- No payout available for losing bets
- User should not see bet in ClaimWinnings component

### **Problem: "No winnings to claim" but user won**

**Solution:**
- Check user_bets table for claimed status
- If claimed = true, payout already claimed
- Verify resolved_outcome matches bet_side
- Check wallet address is correct
