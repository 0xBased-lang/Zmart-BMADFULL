## Implementation Details

**Payout Calculation:**
```rust
let user_pool_share = (user_bet.amount_to_pool as u128)
    .checked_mul(losing_pool as u128)
    .unwrap()
    .checked_div(winning_pool as u128)
    .unwrap();

let gross_payout = user_bet.amount_to_pool
    .checked_add(user_pool_share as u64)
    .unwrap();

// Fees already deducted at bet time
let actual_payout = std::cmp::min(gross_payout, remaining_pool);
```

**Security Features:**
- Overflow protection via checked math
- Reentrancy guards
- Double-claim prevention
- Market status validation

**Edge Cases Handled:**
- Last claimer gets pool remainder
