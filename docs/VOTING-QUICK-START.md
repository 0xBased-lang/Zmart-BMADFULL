## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No proposals currently in voting period"
**Solution:** Your test proposal exists! It's in PENDING status.
- The proposal we created earlier should be visible
- If not, create a new proposal at `/propose`

### "Connect your wallet to vote"
**Solution:** Click the "Connect Wallet" button
- Select Phantom (or your wallet)
- Approve connection
- Vote buttons will appear

### "You have already voted on this proposal"
**Solution:** You can't vote twice (by design)
- This is correct behavior!
- Switch to a different wallet to test multiple votes

### Vote tally not updating
**Solution:** Check real-time connection
- Refresh the page
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify Supabase connection in .env.local
