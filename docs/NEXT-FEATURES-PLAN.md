## 💡 TECHNICAL NOTES

### Transaction Patterns Used:
```typescript
// Pattern 1: Basic transaction
const tx = await program.methods
  .instructionName(args)
  .accounts({ ...accounts })
  .transaction()

await wallet.sendTransaction(tx, connection)

// Pattern 2: With PDA derivation
const [pda] = PublicKey.findProgramAddressSync(seeds, programId)

// Pattern 3: Error handling
try {
  // transaction
  toast.success('Success!')
} catch (error) {
  if (error.message.includes('User rejected')) {
    toast.error('Transaction cancelled')
  }
}
```

### State Management:
- React hooks for local state
- Supabase for server state
- Real-time subscriptions for live updates

### Testing Strategy:
- Manual testing with Playwright
- Real devnet transactions
- Error scenario testing
- Edge case validation
