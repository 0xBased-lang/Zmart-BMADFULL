## What Could Be Improved ⚠️

### Process Issues

1. **BMAD Compliance Gaps**
   - **Issue:** Used manual story creation instead of BMAD workflows
   - **Impact:** Less automation, more manual tracking
   - **Solution:** Transition to `/bmad:bmm:workflows:*` commands for Epic 3

2. **Tool Underutilization**
   - **Issue:** Did not use BMAD specialized agents
   - **Impact:** Missed efficiency gains from agent automation
   - **Solution:** Use `/bmad:bmm:agents:*` for all Epic 3 work

3. **Workflow Status Tracking**
   - **Issue:** bmm-workflow-status.md became out of sync
   - **Impact:** Validation failures, unclear current state
   - **Solution:** Use automated BMAD tools to keep status current

4. **Pre-flight Validation**
   - **Issue:** Did not consistently run `/bmad-pre-flight`
   - **Impact:** Potential compliance violations undetected
   - **Solution:** Mandatory pre-flight at every session start

### Technical Improvements Needed

1. **Testing Gaps**
   - Some edge cases not fully covered
   - Need more integration tests
   - Action: Increase test coverage in Epic 3

2. **Documentation**
   - Some completion docs missing for substories
   - Action: Ensure every story gets completion doc

---

## Metrics & Performance

### Velocity
- **Stories Completed:** 12
- **Time Period:** ~4 days
- **Average:** 3 stories/day

## Action Items for Epic 3

### MANDATORY: Full BMAD Adoption

1. **✅ Activate BMAD Master Agent**
   ```bash
   /bmad:core:agents:bmad-master
   "Orchestrate Epic 3 Frontend & UX development with full BMAD compliance"
   ```

2. **✅ Use BMAD Workflows for Every Story**
   ```bash
   /bmad:bmm:workflows:create-story 3.X
   /bmad:bmm:workflows:story-ready 3.X
   /bmad:bmm:workflows:dev-story 3.X
   /bmad:bmm:workflows:story-done 3.X
   ```

3. **✅ Activate Specialized Agents**
   - UX Expert for all UI work
   - Developer for implementation
   - Test Architect for testing
   - Architect for system design

4. **✅ Run Pre-flight Every Session**
   ```bash
   /bmad-pre-flight
   ```

5. **✅ Maintain Workflow Status**
   - Keep bmm-workflow-status.md current
   - Update after every story
   - Validate alignment regularly

### Process Improvements

1. **Increase Test Coverage**
   - Target: 90%+ coverage for Epic 3
   - Use TEA agent for test strategy

2. **Complete Documentation**
   - Every story gets completion doc
   - No missing docs for Epic 3

3. **Quality Gates**
   - Pre-flight validation mandatory
   - Build must pass before commit
   - TypeScript errors = 0

---

## Technical Debt Identified

### Low Priority
- Some test edge cases not covered
- Minor optimization opportunities in vote aggregation
- Documentation formatting inconsistencies

### Action Plan
- Address during Epic 4 (Testing & Hardening)
- No blocking issues for Epic 3

---

## Key Learnings

### What We Learned

1. **BMAD Tools Are Essential**
   - Manual process is error-prone
   - Automation saves time and ensures compliance
   - MUST use BMAD workflows going forward

2. **Validation Is Critical**
   - Pre-flight catches issues early
   - Workflow status must stay synchronized
   - Regular validation prevents drift

3. **Agent Specialization Matters**
   - Different tasks need different expertise
   - UX Expert for UI, Architect for design, etc.
   - Must activate appropriate agents

4. **Documentation Is Not Optional**
   - Missing docs cause confusion
   - Completion docs essential for tracking
   - Retrospectives catch what we miss

### Recommendations for Epic 3

1. **100% BMAD Compliance**
   - Zero tolerance for bypassing workflows
   - Mandatory pre-flight every session
   - All work through BMAD agents

2. **Frontend Excellence**
   - Heavy use of UX Expert agent
   - Mobile-first approach
   - Accessibility from day one

3. **Testing First**
   - TEA agent for test strategy
   - Tests written alongside code
   - E2E tests for all user flows
