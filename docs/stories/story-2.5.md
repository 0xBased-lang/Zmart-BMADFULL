# Story 2.5: Implement Proposal Approval/Rejection Logic

Status: Complete

## Story

As a platform operator,
I want proposals to automatically approve or reject based on vote results,
So that the community controls market creation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Supabase Edge Function `finalize-proposal-vote` aggregates proposal votes
2. Approval threshold: ≥60% YES votes (configurable parameter)
3. If approved: call ProposalSystem `approve_proposal` instruction → creates market in CoreMarkets
4. If rejected: call ProposalSystem `reject_proposal` instruction → refunds 50% of bond
5. Proposal tax (1% of bond) never refunded, collected regardless of outcome
6. Creator receives full bond refund on approval
7. Market creation event synced to database (via existing event listener)
8. Tests validate approval/rejection flows and bond refunds

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] Implement `finalize-proposal-vote` Supabase Edge Function (AC: #1)
  - [ ] Create function in `supabase/functions/finalize-proposal-vote/`
  - [ ] Aggregate YES/NO votes from `proposal_votes` table
  - [ ] Calculate approval percentage
  - [ ] Handle edge cases (no votes, tie scenarios)

- [ ] Implement Approval Threshold Logic (AC: #2)
  - [ ] Read threshold parameter (default 60%)
  - [ ] Compare vote percentage to threshold
  - [ ] Determine APPROVED vs REJECTED status

- [ ] Integrate ProposalSystem `approve_proposal` Instruction (AC: #3)
  - [ ] Call on-chain instruction via Anchor
  - [ ] Pass proposal_id and vote_result
  - [ ] Verify market created in CoreMarkets
  - [ ] Capture transaction signature

- [ ] Integrate ProposalSystem `reject_proposal` Instruction (AC: #4)
  - [ ] Call on-chain instruction for rejected proposals
  - [ ] Verify 50% bond refund executed
  - [ ] Capture refund transaction

- [ ] Implement Proposal Tax Collection (AC: #5)
  - [ ] Ensure 1% tax collected regardless of outcome
  - [ ] Verify tax NOT refunded in either path
  - [ ] Track tax collection in database

- [ ] Implement Creator Bond Refund Logic (AC: #6)
  - [ ] Full refund on approval (100% of bond)
  - [ ] 50% refund on rejection
  - [ ] Verify refund amounts match bond tier

- [ ] Sync Market Creation Event to Database (AC: #7)
  - [ ] Use existing event listener from Story 1.9
  - [ ] Verify new market appears in `markets` table
  - [ ] Link market to approved proposal_id

- [ ] Write Tests for Approval/Rejection Flows (AC: #8)
  - [ ] Test scenario: Proposal with ≥60% YES → APPROVED → market created
  - [ ] Test scenario: Proposal with <60% YES → REJECTED → 50% refund
  - [ ] Test scenario: Proposal tax collected in both paths
  - [ ] Test scenario: Full bond refund on approval
  - [ ] Test scenario: Edge cases (no votes, exactly 60%, etc.)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Epic 2 Focus:** Community Governance with gas-free voting via Snapshot-style signatures

**Story 2.5 Position:** Bridges off-chain voting (Stories 2.1-2.4) with on-chain execution (Epic 1 Story 1.7)

**Key Components:**
- **Supabase Edge Functions:** Serverless TypeScript functions for vote aggregation
- **ProposalSystem Program:** On-chain Solana program (deployed Epic 1)
- **Event Listener:** Database sync mechanism (Epic 1 Story 1.9)

### Integration Points

**Dependencies:**
- Story 2.4: Proposal voting infrastructure (`proposal_votes` table, vote signatures)
- Epic 1 Story 1.7: ProposalSystem program with `approve_proposal` and `reject_proposal` instructions
- Epic 1 Story 1.5: BondManager for bond escrow and refunds
- Epic 1 Story 1.4: CoreMarkets for market creation

**Data Flow:**
```
proposal_votes table (off-chain)
    ↓
finalize-proposal-vote Edge Function (aggregate votes)
    ↓
approve_proposal OR reject_proposal (on-chain instruction)
    ↓
Market created in CoreMarkets OR Bond refunded via BondManager
    ↓
Event emitted → Database synced via event listener
```

### Project Structure Notes

**New Files:**
- `supabase/functions/finalize-proposal-vote/index.ts` - Edge function for vote aggregation
- `supabase/functions/finalize-proposal-vote/deno.json` - Deno configuration
- Add tests in `tests/` or `supabase/functions/finalize-proposal-vote/test.ts`

**Modified Files:**
- Database may need trigger or cron job to auto-invoke finalization
- ParameterStorage may need `proposal_approval_threshold` parameter

**Alignment with Architecture:**
- Uses Supabase Edge Functions (established pattern)
- Calls Anchor programs via SDK (Epic 1 pattern)
- Event-driven database sync (Epic 1 Story 1.9 pattern)

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Vote aggregation logic (various vote distributions)
- Threshold calculation (edge cases)
- Tax collection verification

**Integration Tests:**
- Full approval flow: votes → aggregate → approve → market created
- Full rejection flow: votes → aggregate → reject → refund
- Database sync validation

**End-to-End Tests:**
- Complete user journey (deferred to Story 2.12)
