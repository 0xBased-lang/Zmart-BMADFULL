3. `finalize_resolution` instruction aggregates votes and determines outcome (YES/NO/CANCELLED)
4. Market status updates to RESOLVED with winning side recorded
5. 48-hour dispute window enforced (market can't finalize until dispute period ends)
6. Admin override capability implemented for MVP progressive decentralization
7. Tests validate voting, aggregation, dispute window, and admin override
8. Deployed to devnet

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

**Community Voting System:**
- VoteRecord: One account per voter per market (prevents double voting)
- ResolutionState: Aggregates all votes for a market
- VoteResult: Stores Snapshot-style off-chain voting results (Epic 2)

**Progressive Decentralization:**
- Epic 1: Admin override capability for MVP phase
- Epic 2: Full decentralization with Snapshot-style voting, admin override removed

**48-Hour Dispute Window:**
- Markets can't finalize until 48 hours after voting starts
- Gives community time to review and dispute fraudulent outcomes
- Configurable via ParameterStorage.dispute_window_seconds

**Snapshot Integration (Epic 2):**
- Off-chain voting with signed messages (gas-free)
- Platform aggregates votes in PostgreSQL
- post_vote_result posts aggregated result on-chain
- Merkle root provides cryptographic verification
- Story 2.3 implements full Snapshot integration

### Project Structure Notes

**File Locations:**
- Program: `programs/market-resolution/src/lib.rs`
- Tests: `tests/market-resolution.ts`
- IDL: `target/idl/market_resolution.json`

**Account Space:**
- VoteRecord: ~70 bytes
- ResolutionState: ~100 bytes
- VoteResult: ~120 bytes

**PDA Seeds:**
- VoteRecord: `["vote-record", market_id, voter]`
- ResolutionState: `["resolution-state", market_id]`
- VoteResult: `["vote-result", market_id]`

### Testing Standards

**Test Coverage Requirements:**
- Unit tests for all instructions
- Integration tests with ParameterStorage
- Dispute window validation testing
- Admin authorization testing
- Vote aggregation and outcome determination testing

**Devnet Testing:**
- Initialize resolution for test markets
- Submit votes from multiple wallets
- Wait for dispute window to pass
- Finalize resolution and verify outcome
- Test admin override capability

### Security Considerations

- **One Vote Per Wallet:** PDA derivation from voter pubkey prevents double voting
- **Dispute Window:** Enforces 48-hour minimum before finalization
- **Admin Authorization:** Only GlobalParameters.authority can override
- **Finalization Protection:** Can't finalize twice, can't vote after finalization

**Implementation Status:** ✅ COMPLETE

**Community Voting System:** The MarketResolution program provides the foundation for community-driven market outcome determination with 48-hour dispute windows and progressive decentralization via admin override (Epic 1 MVP).

**Key Features Implemented:**

1. **VoteRecord Account Structure (AC #1):**
   - Complete struct with 6 fields (~70 bytes)
   - Tracks market_id, voter, vote_choice, vote_weight, timestamp
   - PDA-derived: seeds = ["vote-record", market_id, voter]
   - Prevents double voting (one vote per wallet per market)

2. **ResolutionState Account Structure (AC #3, #5):**
   - Aggregated resolution state per market (~100 bytes)
   - Vote counters: yes_votes, no_votes, cancel_votes
   - total_voters counter for participation tracking
   - is_finalized boolean, outcome option
   - Dispute window timing: voting_started_at, dispute_window_ends_at, finalized_at
   - PDA-derived: seeds = ["resolution-state", market_id]

3. **VoteResult Account Structure (Epic 2 Foundation):**
   - Snapshot-style off-chain voting result (~120 bytes)
   - Stores aggregated vote weights from gas-free voting
   - merkle_root for cryptographic verification
   - posted_at, posted_by, dispute_window_end tracking
   - Foundation for full Snapshot integration in Story 2.3

4. **submit_vote Instruction (AC #2):**
   - Records individual vote on-chain
   - Validates market not already finalized
   - Creates VoteRecord PDA (unique per voter per market)
   - Updates ResolutionState vote counters based on choice
   - Increments total_voters
   - VoteSubmittedEvent emission
   - Placeholder for Epic 2's full Snapshot integration

5. **initialize_resolution Instruction (AC #5):**
   - Starts voting period for market
   - Cross-program integration with ParameterStorage
   - Reads dispute_window_seconds (48 hours)
   - Calculates dispute_window_ends_at
   - Initializes vote counters to 0
   - Sets is_finalized to false
   - ResolutionInitializedEvent emission

6. **finalize_resolution Instruction (AC #3, #4, #5):**
   - Aggregates votes and determines outcome
   - Validates not already finalized
   - Validates dispute window has passed (current_time >= dispute_window_ends_at)
   - Calls determine_outcome helper for majority calculation
   - Updates ResolutionState with winning outcome
   - Sets is_finalized to true, records finalized_at
   - ResolutionFinalizedEvent emission with full vote breakdown
   - Outcome determination: YES/NO/CANCEL by majority, tie defaults to CANCEL

7. **admin_override_resolution Instruction (AC #6):**
   - Progressive decentralization for Epic 1 MVP
   - Validates admin authority (must match GlobalParameters.authority)
   - Immediately finalizes with admin's choice
   - Bypasses dispute window (emergency capability)
   - AdminOverrideEvent emission with admin pubkey
   - Will be removed in Epic 2 for full decentralization

8. **post_vote_result Instruction (Epic 2 Foundation):**
   - Posts Snapshot-style off-chain voting result
   - Platform aggregates gas-free votes in PostgreSQL
   - Posts aggregated result on-chain with merkle root
   - Validates authority (platform posts results)
   - Calculates dispute_window_end (48 hours from posting)
   - VoteResultPostedEvent with cryptographic verification
   - Foundation for Story 2.3 full Snapshot integration

9. **determine_outcome Helper Function (AC #3):**
   - Vote aggregation algorithm
   - Compares yes_votes, no_votes, cancel_votes
   - Returns Cancel if cancel_votes highest
   - Returns Yes if yes_votes > no_votes
   - Returns No if no_votes > yes_votes
   - Returns Cancel on tie (default)
   - Simple plurality voting for Epic 1

10. **48-Hour Dispute Window (AC #5):**
    - Enforced via dispute_window_seconds from ParameterStorage
    - Markets can't finalize until window passes
    - Gives community time to review and dispute
    - DisputeWindowNotEnded error if finalize attempted early
    - Critical for fraud prevention and community governance

11. **Security Features:**
    - One vote per wallet enforced by PDA derivation
    - Cannot vote after market finalized
    - Cannot finalize twice (MarketAlreadyFinalized error)
    - Admin authorization validated against GlobalParameters
    - Dispute window strictly enforced

12. **Event Emissions:**
    - VoteSubmittedEvent (market_id, voter, choice, weight)
    - ResolutionInitializedEvent (market_id, start, window_end)
    - ResolutionFinalizedEvent (market_id, outcome, vote totals)
    - AdminOverrideEvent (market_id, admin, outcome)
    - VoteResultPostedEvent (market_id, outcome, weights, merkle_root)
