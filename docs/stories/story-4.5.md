# Story 4.5: Conduct Internal Security Audit with Anchor Tools

Status: Draft

## Story

As a security-conscious developer,
I want to identify and fix all security vulnerabilities,
So that user funds are safe on mainnet.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Anchor security analyzer run on all 6 programs: `anchor build --verifiable`
2. Solana security scanner (Soteria or similar) run on compiled programs
3. Manual code review checklist completed:
   - Input validation on all instructions
   - Access control (admin-only functions properly gated)
   - Integer overflow/underflow protections
   - Reentrancy protection (where applicable)
   - PDA derivation correctness
   - Token transfer security (no unauthorized drains)
4. Common Solana vulnerabilities checked: signer verification, account ownership, missing owner checks
5. All CRITICAL and HIGH severity findings fixed
6. MEDIUM findings documented with mitigation plans
7. Security audit report generated

## Dev Notes

### Security Architecture Context

From [architecture.md#Security-Architecture](../architecture.md#security-architecture):

**Smart Contract Security Best Practices:**
- Input validation on all instructions
- Admin-only access controls (authority checks)
- PDA derivation for account security
- Reentrancy protection via Anchor framework

**Critical Security Areas:**
1. **Fund Handling**: BondManager, CoreMarkets (betting), payout claims
2. **Access Control**: ParameterStorage (admin functions), MarketResolution (admin override)
3. **State Transitions**: Market status changes, proposal approvals, resolution disputes
4. **Cross-Program Interactions**: Registry lookups, parameter reads, bond transfers

### Anchor Security Tools

**Anchor Build Verification:**
```bash
# Verifiable build ensures deterministic compilation
anchor build --verifiable

# Check for security warnings in build output
```

**Soteria Static Analyzer:**
- Open-source Solana security scanner
- Detects common vulnerabilities automatically
- Installation: `cargo install soteria`
- Usage: `soteria -analyzeAll ./programs`

**Sec3 Analyzer:**
- Commercial-grade Solana security tool
- Comprehensive vulnerability detection
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

### Common Solana Vulnerabilities to Check

From [Sec3 Audit Checklist](https://github.com/sec3-service/learning-center):

1. **Missing Signer Checks**: Verify all sensitive operations require proper signers
2. **Account Data Matching**: Ensure accounts passed match expected types
3. **Owner Checks**: Verify account ownership before reading/writing
4. **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Check all arithmetic operations
5. **Reinitialization**: Prevent accounts from being reinitialized
6. **Arbitrary CPI**: Ensure CPI targets are validated
7. **PDA Collisions**: Verify unique PDA derivations
8. **Type Confusion**: Ensure account discriminators are checked

### Program-Specific Security Focus

**program-registry:**
- Ensure only admin can register/update programs
- Verify program address validation before registration
- Check for program address spoofing

**parameter-storage:**
- Verify admin authority on all update instructions
- Check parameter bounds (max change %, cooldown periods)
- Ensure feature toggles cannot be bypassed

**core-markets:**
- Validate bet amounts and odds calculations
- Check for rounding exploits in fee distribution
- Verify market state transitions (ACTIVE â†’ RESOLVED)
- Ensure payout calculations cannot overflow

**market-resolution:**
- Validate vote aggregation logic for manipulation
- Check dispute window timing enforcement
- Verify admin override requires proper authority
- Ensure vote counts cannot be tampered

**proposal-system:**
- Validate proposal creation authorization
- Check bond refund logic for exploits
- Verify creator fee claims cannot be double-spent
- Ensure approval/rejection state transitions are atomic

**bond-manager:**
- Critical: Verify all deposit/withdrawal authorization
- Check for reentrancy in refund logic
- Ensure graduated bond calculations are exploit-proof
- Verify creator fee distribution cannot drain bonds

### Testing Strategy

**Pre-Audit:**
- Ensure all tests from Stories 4.1, 4.2, 4.3 are passing
- Baseline test coverage: >80% (from Story 4.1 AC #8)

**Post-Fix:**
- Re-run all test suites to catch regressions
- Add new tests for discovered vulnerabilities
- Update integration tests if fixes change behavior

### Project Structure Notes

**Security-Related Files:**
- Anchor programs: `programs/*/src/lib.rs`, `programs/*/src/state.rs`
- Test suites: `tests/*.ts` (for validation after fixes)
- Configuration: `Anchor.toml` (network and build settings)

**Audit Outputs:**
- Security audit report: `docs/security-audit-report.md`
- Issue tracking: GitHub Issues with `security` label
- Fix tracking: Link PRs to security issues
