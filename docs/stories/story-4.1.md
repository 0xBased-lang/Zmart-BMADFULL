# Story 4.1: Implement Comprehensive Unit Tests for Solana Programs

2. CoreMarkets tests: betting, odds calculation, fee distribution, edge cases (dust, rounding)
3. MarketResolution tests: voting, aggregation, dispute window, admin override
4. ProposalSystem tests: creation, approval, rejection, bond refunds
5. BondManager tests: deposit, refund scenarios, creator fee claims
6. ParameterStorage tests: parameter updates, safety constraints, toggle management
7. ProgramRegistry tests: registration, lookup, version tracking
8. Test coverage measured: >80% line coverage on critical functions
9. All tests passing on localnet

## Dev Notes

### Testing Standards

**Anchor Testing Framework:**
- Use `anchor test` command for all Solana program tests
- Tests written in TypeScript using Mocha/Chai
- Solana Test Validator runs in background for localnet testing
- Use `before()` hooks for test account setup
- Use `it()` blocks for individual test cases

**Test Coverage Goals:**
- Critical paths: 100% coverage (betting, payouts, resolution)
- Business logic: >90% coverage (fee calculation, bond refunds)
- Edge cases: >80% coverage (dust, rounding, limits)
- Admin functions: >70% coverage (parameter updates, overrides)

**Testing Pattern:**
```typescript
describe('CoreMarkets', () => {
  let program: Program<CoreMarkets>;
  let provider: AnchorProvider;

  before(async () => {
    // Setup test accounts and program
    provider = AnchorProvider.env();
    program = anchor.workspace.CoreMarkets;
  });

  it('places a YES bet correctly', async () => {
    // Arrange: Create market and fund user
    // Act: Place bet
    // Assert: Verify pool updates and odds calculation
  });
});
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Program Locations:**
- `programs/program-registry/` - ProgramRegistry tests
- `programs/parameter-storage/` - ParameterStorage tests
- `programs/core-markets/` - CoreMarkets tests
- `programs/market-resolution/` - MarketResolution tests
- `programs/proposal-system/` - ProposalSystem tests
- `programs/bond-manager/` - BondManager tests

**Test Files Pattern:**
- Each program has `tests/` directory
- Test file naming: `{program-name}.ts`
- Helper utilities in `tests/utils/`

### Test Data Management

**Test Accounts:**
- Create deterministic test accounts using keypairs
- Use consistent SOL funding amounts (100 SOL per test account)
- Reset account states between tests for isolation

**Test Markets:**
- Use consistent test market parameters
- Market IDs: test-market-1, test-market-2, etc.
- End dates: Use fixed future timestamps for determinism

### Critical Test Scenarios

**CoreMarkets:**
- Bet placement updates pools correctly
- Odds calculation is accurate: YES% = yes_pool / total_pool
- Fee distribution splits correctly (BPS-based)
- Minimum bet enforcement (from ParameterStorage)
- Maximum bet enforcement (from ParameterStorage)
- Dust amounts handled without panic
- Rounding errors bounded to acceptable range

**MarketResolution:**
- Vote weights calculated correctly (democratic vs activity-based)
- Outcome determined by majority vote
- Dispute window prevents early finalization
- Admin override works for disputed markets
- Market status transitions correctly

**ProposalSystem:**
- Bond requirement enforced
- Proposal tax collected (1% non-refundable)
- Approval threshold (≥60% YES) works correctly
- Rejected proposals refund 50% of bond
- Graduated bond scaling affects creator fee tier
- Markets created from approved proposals

**BondManager:**
- Escrow PDA derivation secure
- Bond deposits transfer correctly
- Full refund on proposal success
- Partial refund on proposal rejection
- Creator fees claimable after market resolution

**ParameterStorage:**
- Only admin can update parameters
- Cooldown period enforced between updates
- Max change % prevents drastic changes
- Feature toggles enable/disable features

**ProgramRegistry:**
- Only admin can register programs
- Program lookup by name works
- Version tracking maintains history

### Integration with Previous Stories

**Dependencies on Epic 1 (Foundation):**
- All 6 Solana programs implemented (Stories 1.1-1.7)
- Programs deployed to devnet (Story 1.12)
- Program functionality validated end-to-end

**Dependencies on Epic 2 (Governance):**
- Snapshot-style voting implemented (Stories 2.1-2.5)
- Dispute mechanism functional (Story 2.6)
- Admin override capability (Story 2.7)

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- Anchor workspace configured (Story 1.1)
- Solana Test Validator available
- Test accounts funded with devnet SOL

### Alignment with Architecture

**Testing Strategy from Architecture:**
- Unit tests for all smart contracts
- >80% code coverage on critical paths
- Edge case testing (dust, rounding, limits)
- Security testing (access control, PDA validation)

**Test Execution:**
```bash
# Run all program tests
anchor test

# Run tests for specific program
anchor test --skip-deploy --tests programs/core-markets

# Run with coverage
anchor test --coverage

# Run on localnet
anchor test --provider.cluster localnet
```

### Performance Considerations

**Test Execution Time:**
- Target: <5 minutes for full test suite
- Use parallel test execution where possible
- Skip deployment in iterative testing (--skip-deploy)
- Cache test accounts between runs

**Test Reliability:**
- Use deterministic test data
- Avoid time-based flakiness
- Reset state between tests
- Handle transaction timeouts gracefully
