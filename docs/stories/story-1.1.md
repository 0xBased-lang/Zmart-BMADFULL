# Story 1.1: Initialize Anchor Workspace and Development Environment

Status: Done

## Story

As a developer,
I want to set up the complete Anchor workspace with all 6 programs,
So that I have a structured development environment ready for implementation.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Anchor workspace initialized with `anchor init bmad-zmart`
2. All 6 program directories created: `program-registry`, `parameter-storage`, `core-markets`, `market-resolution`, `proposal-system`, `bond-manager`
3. Anchor.toml configured with correct program IDs and cluster settings
4. Basic "Hello World" program compiles and deploys to localnet successfully
5. Solana CLI installed and configured for devnet access
6. Development wallet funded with devnet SOL

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Technology Stack (from architecture.md):**
- Anchor Framework: 0.32.1
- Solana CLI: 2.1.15
- Rust: 1.85.0
- @solana/web3.js: 1.95.x

**Multi-Program Workspace Pattern:**
- This story establishes a modular 6-program architecture
- Each program is independent with its own Cargo.toml and lib.rs
- Programs will interact via the Registry Pattern (implemented in Story 1.2)
- Anchor workspace manages all programs in a single repository

**Initialization Commands (from architecture.md, lines 24-46):**
```bash
# Step 1: Initialize Anchor workspace
anchor init bmad-zmart
cd bmad-zmart

# Step 2: Create 6 program directories
mkdir -p programs/{program-registry,parameter-storage,core-markets,market-resolution,proposal-system,bond-manager}
```

**Program Structure per architecture.md:**
- Each program directory must contain:
  - `Cargo.toml` - Rust package manifest
  - `src/lib.rs` - Program entry point
  - `src/state.rs` - Account structures (added in subsequent stories)
  - `src/errors.rs` - Custom error codes (added in subsequent stories)
  - `src/instructions/` - Instruction handlers (added in subsequent stories)

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with unified project structure (architecture.md, lines 116-313):**

Expected final structure after this story:
```
bmad-zmart/
├── Anchor.toml                          # ✓ Created by anchor init

└── tests/                               # ✓ Created by anchor init
    └── [program-name].ts                # ✓ One test file per program
```

**Detected conflicts or variances:** None. This is a foundational story establishing the base structure.

### Testing Standards Summary

**From architecture.md Testing Strategy (lines 657-678):**
- Anchor programs: >90% coverage target (security critical)
- Test files generated by `anchor init` in `tests/` directory
- Each program should have corresponding test file (e.g., `tests/program-registry.ts`)

**For this story:**
- Basic test scaffolding created by `anchor init`
- Verify "Hello World" functionality compiles and deploys
- Full test implementation comes in Story 4.1
