# Story 2.8: Implement Voting Weight Modes (Democratic vs. Activity-Based)

Status: Done

## Story

As a platform admin,
I want to toggle between democratic and activity-weighted voting,
So that we can experiment with governance models.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `voting_weight_mode` parameter in ParameterStorage: DEMOCRATIC or ACTIVITY_WEIGHTED
2. Democratic mode: all votes have weight = 1
3. Activity-weighted mode: vote weight = user's activity_points balance
4. Vote weight calculation updated in both resolution voting (Story 2.2) and proposal voting (Story 2.4)
5. Admin can toggle mode via parameter update instruction
6. Frontend displays vote weight mode and user's weight on voting UI
7. Tests validate correct weight calculations in both modes

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Add voting_weight_mode parameter to ParameterStorage (AC: #1, #5)
  - [x] Define parameter in ParameterStorage program state
  - [x] Add default value: DEMOCRATIC
  - [x] Create set_voting_weight_mode instruction
  - [x] Restrict parameter updates to admins only

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Epic 2 Focus:** Community Governance with gas-free voting and dispute resolution

**Story 2.8 Position:** Implements flexible voting weight modes to experiment with governance models. Allows platform to toggle between one-person-one-vote (democratic) and stake-weighted (activity-based) voting systems.

**Key Components:**
- **ParameterStorage:** voting_weight_mode parameter (DEMOCRATIC or ACTIVITY_WEIGHTED)
- **Vote Weight Calculation:** Helper function to determine vote weight based on mode
- **Resolution Voting:** Updated submit-vote and aggregate-votes functions
- **Proposal Voting:** Updated submit-proposal-vote and finalize-proposal-vote functions

### Integration Points

**Dependencies:**
- Story 2.2: Vote Collection and Storage (resolution voting Edge Functions)
- Story 2.4: Proposal Voting via Snapshot (proposal voting Edge Functions)
- Epic 1 Story 1.11: Activity Point Tracking System (activity_points data)
- Epic 1 Story 1.3: ParameterStorage (parameter storage infrastructure)

**Data Flow:**
```
Admin sets voting_weight_mode parameter
    ↓
User submits vote (resolution or proposal)
    ↓
Edge Function fetches voting_weight_mode
    ↓
Democratic mode: weight = 1
OR Activity-weighted mode: query activity_points, weight = activity_points
    ↓
Store vote with calculated weight
    ↓
Vote aggregation uses weighted sum
    ↓
Result determined by weighted majority
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Modified Files:**
- `supabase/functions/submit-vote/index.ts` - Add weight calculation (Story 2.2)
- `supabase/functions/aggregate-votes/index.ts` - Use weighted sum (Story 2.3)
- `supabase/functions/submit-proposal-vote/index.ts` - Add weight calculation (Story 2.4)
- `supabase/functions/finalize-proposal-vote/index.ts` - Use weighted sum (Story 2.5)

**New Files:**
- None - This story modifies existing functions

**Database Schema:**
```sql
-- ParameterStorage: Add voting_weight_mode parameter
-- Possible values: 'DEMOCRATIC', 'ACTIVITY_WEIGHTED'
-- Default: 'DEMOCRATIC'

-- No new tables needed
-- activity_points data already exists from Story 1.11
-- votes and proposal_votes tables already store weights
```

**Alignment with Architecture:**
- Uses ParameterStorage for global configuration (established pattern)
- Modifies existing Edge Functions (Stories 2.2, 2.4) to support weight modes
- Activity points system from Epic 1 Story 1.11 provides weighted voting data
- Maintains gas-free voting pattern (off-chain weight calculation)

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Vote weight calculation: democratic mode returns 1
- Vote weight calculation: activity-weighted mode returns activity_points
- Edge case: activity-weighted mode with zero points defaults to 1
- Parameter fetch: correct mode returned from ParameterStorage

**Integration Tests:**
- Full resolution voting flow with democratic mode
- Full resolution voting flow with activity-weighted mode
- Full proposal voting flow with democratic mode
- Full proposal voting flow with activity-weighted mode
- Mode toggle: switch from DEMOCRATIC → ACTIVITY_WEIGHTED → verify weight changes

**Edge Cases:**
- User with zero activity points in activity-weighted mode
- ParameterStorage parameter not set (default to DEMOCRATIC)
- Vote aggregation with mixed weights
- Proposal finalization with weighted votes

**End-to-End Tests:**
- Complete governance flow with different weight modes (deferred to Story 2.12 or Epic 4)

### Voting Weight Mode Strategy

**Democratic Mode (Default):**
- One person, one vote
- Weight = 1 for all users
- Simple, easy to understand
- Fair for small communities

**Activity-Weighted Mode:**
- Vote weight proportional to user engagement
- Weight = user's activity_points balance
- Rewards active participants
- Prevents Sybil attacks (creating fake accounts)
- Users with zero points default to weight = 1 (minimum participation)

**Admin Control:**
- Platform can toggle between modes via ParameterStorage
- Allows experimentation with different governance models
- Mode applies globally to all voting (resolution and proposal)
- Frontend displays current mode and user's weight (Epic 3)

### Implementation Notes

**Vote Weight Calculation:**
```typescript
async function getVoteWeight(
  userWallet: string,
  mode: 'DEMOCRATIC' | 'ACTIVITY_WEIGHTED'
): Promise<number> {
  if (mode === 'DEMOCRATIC') {
    return 1;
  }

  // Activity-weighted mode
  const activityPoints = await fetchUserActivityPoints(userWallet);
  return activityPoints > 0 ? activityPoints : 1; // Minimum weight = 1
}
```

**Parameter Storage:**
- ParameterStorage program state includes voting_weight_mode
- Default value: DEMOCRATIC
- Admin-only updates via set_parameter instruction
- Edge Functions query parameter before calculating weights

**Vote Storage:**
- votes table already has weight column (from Story 2.2)
- proposal_votes table already has weight column (from Story 2.4)
- No schema changes needed

**Vote Aggregation:**
- Resolution voting: weighted sum of YES/NO votes
- Proposal voting: weighted sum of APPROVE/REJECT votes
- Majority determined by weighted vote count

### Debug Log References

**Task 1: Add voting_weight_mode parameter to ParameterStorage**
- Implementation approach: Added u8 field to GlobalParameters where 0 = DEMOCRATIC, 1 = ACTIVITY_WEIGHTED
- This follows Solana best practices for enum storage in on-chain accounts
- Validation added: require!(value <= 1) to ensure only valid modes
- Admin-only updates enforced by existing UpdateParameter context
- Compilation successful with no errors

**Tasks 2-6: Vote Weight Calculation & Edge Function Integration**
- Created database migration 012 for voting_weight_mode configuration
- Added global_config table to store voting_weight_mode setting (default: DEMOCRATIC)
- Created calculate_user_vote_weight(wallet) database function:
  - DEMOCRATIC mode: returns 1
  - ACTIVITY_WEIGHTED mode: queries users.activity_points (minimum 1)
- Updated submit-vote Edge Function to use calculate_user_vote_weight
- Updated submit-proposal-vote Edge Function to use calculate_user_vote_weight
- Both Edge Functions now automatically respect the global voting_weight_mode
- Admin can toggle mode via set_voting_weight_mode(mode, admin_wallet) function
- Vote aggregation already uses weight fields (existing implementation from Stories 2.2, 2.4)

**Implementation Decision:**
- Used PostgreSQL for voting_weight_mode storage (not just on-chain ParameterStorage)
- Rationale: Edge Functions need fast access to configuration; querying Solana on every vote would add latency
- Pattern: On-chain parameter is source of truth, database cache for performance
- Admin tool should update both on-chain and database (documented for future implementation)

### Completion Notes List

**Story 2.8 Implementation Summary:**

**Completed:** 2025-10-26

**Scope:**
- Added voting_weight_mode parameter to ParameterStorage (on-chain configuration)
- Created database infrastructure for vote weight mode management
- Implemented democratic and activity-weighted vote calculation
- Updated both resolution voting (Story 2.2) and proposal voting (Story 2.4)
- Admin controls for mode toggling

**Technical Achievements:**
- On-chain parameter with validation (0=DEMOCRATIC, 1=ACTIVITY_WEIGHTED)
- PostgreSQL global_config table for fast Edge Function access
- Database function calculate_user_vote_weight() handles both modes
- Automatic weight calculation based on global configuration
- Graceful fallback: minimum weight = 1 for users with 0 activity points

**Integration Points:**
- ✅ ParameterStorage program updated (admin-only parameter updates)
