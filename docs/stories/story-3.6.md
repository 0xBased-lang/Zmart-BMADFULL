## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Frontend Stack:**
- Next.js 15 with App Router
- React Hook Form for form management
- TypeScript for type safety
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Solana Wallet Adapter for wallet integration

**ProposalSystem Integration:**
- Program: `ProposalSystem` (Epic 1, Story 1.7)
- Instruction: `create_proposal`
- Accounts: proposer, proposal PDA, bond vault, system program
- Bond mechanics: graduated refund based on proposal outcome

**Database Sync:**
- Event listener will sync proposal creation to `proposals` table
- Frontend should show optimistic UI update then confirm from DB

### Project Structure Notes

**New Files:**
```
frontend/app/propose/
  ├── page.tsx                    # Server component wrapper
  └── ProposalWizard.tsx          # Client component

frontend/app/propose/components/
  ├── Step1MarketInfo.tsx         # Title + category
  ├── Step2Resolution.tsx         # Criteria + date
  ├── Step3BondSelection.tsx      # Bond tier selector
  └── Step4Preview.tsx            # Final preview

  └── useProposalSubmit.ts        # Proposal submission hook

frontend/lib/types/
  └── proposal.ts                 # TypeScript types
```

**Alignment with Existing:**
- Follow patterns from Story 3.4 (market detail) for Solana integration
- Use Supabase client from Story 3.2 for database queries
- Reuse wallet hooks from Story 3.1

### Technical Constraints

**Bond Mechanics** (from Epic 2):
- Minimum bond: 50 ZMart
- Proposal tax: 1% of bond (non-refundable)
- Creator fee tiers:
  - 100 ZMart bond → 0.5% market fee
  - 500 ZMart bond → 2% market fee
- Bond refund:
  - 100% if approved
  - 50% if rejected
  - 0% if cancelled

**Validation Rules:**
- Title: 10-200 characters
- End date: Future date, max 2 years from now
- Bond: Minimum 50 ZMart
- Resolution criteria: Required, recommend 50-500 characters

### Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests:** Form validation logic
2. **Integration Tests:** Proposal transaction creation
3. **E2E Tests:** Complete proposal creation flow
4. **Devnet Testing:** End-to-end with real Solana transaction

  - Color-coded amounts (green=refundable, red=non-refundable, blue=conditional)
  - Pre-submission checklist with important reminders
- Added handleEditStep function in ProposalWizard for navigation
- Updated ProposalWizard to render Step4Preview with edit callback

**Task 5 - Form Validation (2025-10-27):**
- Validation implemented throughout Tasks 1-4:
  - Zod schema (proposalSchema.ts) defines all validation rules (title length, date range, bond minimum)
  - React Hook Form integration validates onBlur and before step navigation
  - All step components display inline error messages via errors.fieldName.message
  - ProposalWizard handleNext() triggers validation before allowing navigation
  - Preview step displays all data, implicitly validating completeness
- No additional code needed - validation is comprehensive and integrated

**Task 6 - ProposalSystem Transaction Integration (2025-10-27):**
- Created useProposalSubmit hook following Story 3.4 betting patterns:
  - AnchorProvider setup with wallet and connection
  - ProposalSystem program initialization from IDL
  - PDA derivation for proposal account
  - Transaction building with create_proposal instruction
  - Bond amount conversion (ZMart to lamports: 1 ZMart = 1M lamports)
  - Unix timestamp conversion for endDate
  - Wallet signature via sendTransaction
  - Transaction confirmation with 'confirmed' commitment
  - Comprehensive error handling (wallet connection, insufficient funds, user rejection)
  - Toast notifications for success/error feedback
- Integrated hook into ProposalWizard:
  - onSubmit handler calls submitProposal with form data
  - Loading state during transaction (isSubmittingTx)
  - Navigation to success page on completion
- NOTE: Uses placeholder addresses for globalParameters, bondEscrow, bondManagerProgram - will be updated with deployed addresses in Task 8

**Task 7 - Success State (2025-10-27):**
- Created success page (`/propose/success`) with dynamic data from URL params (signature, proposalId):
  - Success icon and heading
  - Proposal ID display
  - Transaction signature with Solana Explorer link (devnet)
  - Real-time voting period countdown (7 days, updates every second)
  - Formatted end date display
  - "What happens next" info box (database sync, voting process, bond refund)
  - "Create Another Proposal" button (navigates to /propose)
  - "View Proposal" link (navigates to /voting/{proposalId} - future feature)
  - "Back to Home" link
- Used useSearchParams for URL param parsing
- Used useRouter for navigation
- Used useEffect with interval for countdown updates
- Responsive design with mobile-friendly layout

**Task 8 - Testing and Validation (2025-10-27):**

**Pre-Devnet Testing Checklist:**
- [x] TypeScript compilation (no type errors)
- [x] All components use proper types from Zod schema
- [x] Form validation integrated throughout
- [x] Transaction hook follows established patterns

**Devnet Testing Requirements (TO BE COMPLETED):**
1. **Deploy Program Addresses** - Update useProposalSubmit.ts with actual addresses:
   - globalParameters PDA from ParameterStorage
   - bondEscrow PDA from BondManager
   - bondManagerProgram ID
2. **Get Devnet SOL** - Airdrop SOL to test wallet for transaction fees
3. **End-to-End Flow Test:**
   - Navigate to /propose
   - Fill Step 1: Title (10-200 chars), Category selection
   - Fill Step 2: Resolution criteria (50+ chars), End date (future, <2 years), Evidence (optional)
   - Fill Step 3: Bond amount (50-1000 ZMart), Review tier and fees
   - Review Step 4: Verify all data, Check fee breakdown
   - Submit: Connect wallet, Sign transaction, Confirm on Solana
   - Success: Verify proposal ID, Check Explorer link, View countdown
4. **Form Validation Tests:**
   - Title: Test <10 chars (error), 10-200 chars (valid), >200 chars (error)
   - End date: Test past date (error), future date (valid), >2 years (error)
   - Bond: Test <50 (error), 50-1000 (valid), Check tier changes
   - Step navigation: Verify cannot proceed with invalid fields
5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Wallet not connected → Error message
   - Insufficient SOL → Error toast
   - Transaction rejected → Proper error handling
   - Network timeout → Retry logic
6. **Integration Tests:**
   - Proposal appears in Supabase database (via event listener)
   - Proposal ID matches on-chain vs database
   - All form data persisted correctly
7. **Responsive Design:** Test on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1024px+)
8. **Accessibility:** Keyboard navigation, Screen reader labels, Focus indicators

**Known TODOs for Devnet Testing:**
- Update placeholder addresses in useProposalSubmit.ts (line 67-69)
- Test with real wallet on devnet
- Verify event listener syncs proposal to database
- Test voting page integration (Story 3.7)

## Future Enhancements (Deferred)

### Bonding System Flexibility

**User Feedback (2025-10-27):**
- Current 3-tier system is simplified compared to more flexible bonding
- Single slider controls bond amount → 3 fixed fee percentages only
- No separation between "market creation fee" and "bond"
- Limited flexibility in fee structure

**Current Implementation:**
- Matches Solana program's 3-tier structure (per IDL):
  - Tier1 (Low): 50-99 ZMart → 2% creator fee
  - Tier2 (Medium): 100-499 ZMart → 1% creator fee
  - Tier3 (High): 500+ ZMart → 0.5% creator fee
- Bond tier enum properly passed to ProposalSystem program
- Functional and working as designed

**Enhancement Proposal (Future Epic):**
- Separate "Market Creation Fee" from "Creator Bond"
- More granular fee percentage options (not just 3 tiers)
- Dynamic percentage calculation based on bond amount
- Clearer distinction between non-refundable fee vs refundable bond

**Scope:**
- Requires Solana program changes (new instruction parameters)
- Updated IDL structure
- Frontend redesign (two separate inputs vs single slider)
- Potentially Epic 5 or Story 4.x

**Priority:** Low (current system is functional, enhancement is UX improvement)
