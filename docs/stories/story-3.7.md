# Story 3.7: Build Voting Interface for Market Resolutions

**Status:** Ready for Review
**Epic:** 3 - Frontend & UX
**Story Points:** 5
**Priority:** P0

---

## Story

As a **voter**,
I want **to vote on market resolutions with my wallet signature**,
So that **I can help determine outcomes without spending gas**.

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ Voting route `/vote` lists all markets in VOTING status
2. ✅ Each market card shows: title, resolution criteria, voting period countdown, current vote tally (YES %, NO %)
3. ✅ "Review Evidence" button expands panel with community comments and evidence links
4. ✅ Vote buttons: large YES and NO buttons
5. ✅ Clicking vote button triggers wallet signature request (message signing, NOT transaction)
6. ✅ Signature submitted to backend API (`/api/submit-vote`) for verification and storage
7. ✅ Vote confirmation shown with user's vote choice and weight
8. ✅ User's vote weight displayed (1 in democratic mode, activity_points in weighted mode)
9. ✅ Participation counter: "1,247 users voted (62% participation)"
10. ✅ Successfully submits gas-free vote and updates UI

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

**Snapshot-Style Voting (Gas-Free):**
```typescript
// Frontend: Sign message (NOT a transaction)
const voteMessage = {
  market_id: string,
  vote_choice: 'YES' | 'NO',
  timestamp: number,
  nonce: number
};
const signature = await wallet.signMessage(JSON.stringify(voteMessage));

// Backend: Verify Ed25519 signature
const valid = nacl.sign.detached.verify(messageBytes, signature, publicKey);

// Store off-chain in PostgreSQL
INSERT INTO votes (market_id, voter_wallet, vote_choice, signature, vote_weight);
```

**Vote Weight Calculation:**
- Democratic mode: `vote_weight = 1` (equal voting power)
- Activity-based mode: `vote_weight = user.activity_points` (meritocratic)

**Real-Time Updates:**
- Subscribe to `votes` table changes using Supabase real-time
- Update vote tallies immediately when new votes come in
- Use optimistic UI updates for user's own vote

### Component Structure

```
app/
  vote/
    page.tsx                    # Voting interface page
    components/
      VotingMarketCard.tsx      # Market card with vote buttons
      VoteButtons.tsx           # YES/NO button pair
      VoteTally.tsx             # Vote percentage display
      EvidencePanel.tsx         # Collapsible evidence section
      VotingCountdown.tsx       # Time remaining timer
```

### API Endpoints

**Frontend API Routes:**
- `/api/submit-vote` - Proxy to Supabase Edge Function

**Supabase Edge Functions:**
- `/verify-vote-signature` - Ed25519 signature verification (Story 2.1)
- `/submit-vote` - Vote storage and validation (Story 2.2)

### Database Schema

**votes table:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE votes (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY,
  market_id UUID REFERENCES markets(id),
  voter_wallet TEXT NOT NULL,
  vote_choice TEXT NOT NULL, -- 'YES' or 'NO'
  signature TEXT NOT NULL,
  vote_weight INT NOT NULL,
  timestamp TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(market_id, voter_wallet) -- One vote per user per market
);

CREATE INDEX idx_votes_market ON votes(market_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_votes_voter ON votes(voter_wallet);
```

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**
- Vote message formatting
- Signature verification logic
- Vote weight calculation

**Integration Tests:**
- Full voting flow (sign → submit → verify → store)
- Real-time updates subscription
- Duplicate vote prevention

**E2E Tests (Playwright):**
- Connect wallet → vote → verify confirmation
- Test both vote choices (YES/NO)
- Test error cases (wallet not connected, signature rejected)

### Debug Log References

### Completion Notes List

- **Snapshot Voting Implementation**: Successfully implemented gas-free voting using wallet.signMessage() pattern. Users sign vote messages without creating blockchain transactions, achieving zero gas fees for voters.
- **Real-Time Vote Tallies**: Integrated Supabase real-time subscriptions for live vote count updates. Vote percentages and participation counters update automatically when new votes are cast.
- **Comprehensive Error Handling**: Implemented robust error handling for wallet connection failures, signature rejection, duplicate votes, and network errors with user-friendly toast notifications.
- **Evidence Review System**: Created collapsible evidence panel with community comments, evidence links, and sortable display (newest, oldest, most helpful).
- **Backend Integration**: API route proxies to Supabase Edge Functions (verify-vote-signature and submit-vote from Epic 2) for signature verification and vote storage with duplicate prevention.
- **Vote Weight Support**: Implemented democratic mode (weight=1) with foundation for activity-based mode (weight=user.activity_points).
- **Testing Coverage**: Created 12 comprehensive E2E tests covering full voting flow, edge cases, and responsive design.
