# Story 4.3: Implement Frontend E2E Tests with Playwright

Status: Done

## Story

As a developer,
I want automated end-to-end tests covering all user journeys,
So that frontend changes don't break core workflows.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Playwright test suite with wallet mocking/automation
2. Test: User connects wallet → browses markets → places bet → transaction succeeds
3. Test: User proposes market → votes on proposal → proposal approves → market created
4. Test: User votes on resolution → dispute flagged → admin reviews → market resolves
5. Test: User claims payout after winning bet
6. Test: Mobile responsive design (viewport testing)
7. Test: Accessibility (keyboard navigation, screen reader)
8. All E2E tests passing against devnet backend

## Dev Notes

### Testing Strategy

**Playwright Configuration:**
- Test against devnet Solana RPC endpoint
- Use deterministic test wallets with devnet SOL
- Mock Supabase real-time subscriptions for predictable tests
- Parallel execution for faster CI/CD runs
- Automatic screenshot/video capture on failures

**Test Environment:**
```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  testDir: './e2e',
  fullyParallel: true,
  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,
  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',
    trace: 'on-first-retry',
    screenshot: 'only-on-failure'
  },
  projects: [
    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },
    { name: 'firefox', use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },
    { name: 'webkit', use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } },
    { name: 'mobile-chrome', use: { ...devices['Pixel 5'] } },
    { name: 'mobile-safari', use: { ...devices['iPhone 12'] } }
  ]
})
```

### Wallet Automation Strategy

**Phantom Wallet Mocking:**
- Intercept `window.solana` object
- Mock wallet connection, signing, and transaction approval
- Use test keypairs with known private keys
- Simulate approval/rejection flows

**Test Wallet Setup:**
```typescript
// e2e/fixtures/wallet.ts
const TEST_WALLET = {
  publicKey: new PublicKey('...'),
  secretKey: Uint8Array.from([...])
}

export async function mockPhantomWallet(page: Page) {
  await page.addInitScript(() => {
    window.solana = {
      isPhantom: true,
      publicKey: TEST_WALLET.publicKey,
      connect: async () => ({ publicKey: TEST_WALLET.publicKey }),
      signTransaction: async (tx) => tx,
      signAllTransactions: async (txs) => txs
    }
  })
}
```

### Critical User Journeys

**Journey 1: First-Time User Bets on Market**
1. Lands on homepage
2. Sees list of active markets
3. Connects Phantom wallet
4. Clicks market to view details
5. Places YES bet for 10 SOL
6. Approves transaction in wallet
7. Sees confirmation toast
8. Navigates to dashboard
9. Sees active bet with current odds

**Journey 2: Power User Creates Market**
1. Connects wallet with sufficient SOL
2. Navigates to Propose page
3. Fills market creation form
4. Submits proposal with bond
5. Proposal enters voting period
6. User votes YES on own proposal
7. Other users vote
8. Proposal reaches quorum and approves
9. Market created and appears on homepage

**Journey 3: Governance Participant Resolves Market**
1. Market end time passes
2. User navigates to Vote page
3. Sees markets awaiting resolution
4. Casts resolution vote based on evidence
5. Vote aggregates with others
6. Resolution reaches consensus
7. Market enters 48-hour dispute window
8. No disputes filed
9. Market finalizes to resolved state

**Journey 4: Winner Claims Payout**
1. User has winning bet on resolved market
2. Navigates to dashboard
3. Sees "Claimable" tab with payout amount
4. Clicks "Claim Payout" button
5. Approves on-chain transaction
6. Receives SOL to wallet
7. Bet marked as claimed in UI

### Test Data Management

**Devnet Test Data:**
- Pre-seed devnet with test markets in various states
- Use consistent test market IDs for deterministic tests
- Reset database state between test runs
- Isolate test data from dev environment

**Test Markets:**
```typescript
const TEST_MARKETS = {
  ACTIVE_MARKET: 'test-market-1-active',
  ENDED_MARKET: 'test-market-2-ended',
  RESOLVED_MARKET: 'test-market-3-resolved',
  DISPUTED_MARKET: 'test-market-4-disputed'
}
```

### Responsive Design Test Matrix

| Viewport | Width | Tests |
|----------|-------|-------|
| Mobile Portrait | 375px | Hamburger menu, touch targets, stacked layouts |
| Mobile Landscape | 667px | Horizontal scroll, rotated views |
| Tablet Portrait | 768px | 2-column grids, medium breakpoint |
| Tablet Landscape | 1024px | 3-column grids, large breakpoint |
| Desktop | 1280px+ | Full navigation, all features visible |

### Accessibility Test Coverage

**WCAG 2.1 AA Requirements:**
- **Perceivable:** Text alternatives, color contrast ≥4.5:1, responsive text
- **Operable:** Keyboard accessible, no keyboard traps, focus visible
- **Understandable:** Readable text, predictable navigation, error identification
- **Robust:** Valid HTML, ARIA where needed, compatible with assistive tech

**Test Tools:**
- Playwright accessibility assertions
- axe-core integration for automated checks
- Manual keyboard navigation testing
- Screen reader testing (VoiceOver, NVDA)

- Story 3.4: Market detail page (test betting)
- Story 3.5: Dashboard (test bet tracking, claim payouts)
- Story 3.6: Propose page (test market creation)

- Requires devnet RPC endpoint configured
- Requires test wallets with devnet SOL from faucet

**Dependencies on Epic 2 (Governance):**
- Requires Snapshot-style voting implemented (Stories 2.1-2.4)

### Alignment with Architecture

**Testing Standards from Architecture:**
- End-to-end testing with Playwright (architecture.md line 46)
- Cross-browser compatibility testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- Mobile viewport testing (responsive design validation)
- Accessibility compliance testing (WCAG 2.1 AA)

**Devnet Configuration:**
```typescript
// frontend/.env.test
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=devnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOLANA_RPC_URL=https://api.devnet.solana.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=...
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=...
```

### CI/CD Integration

**GitHub Actions Workflow:**
```yaml
name: E2E Tests
on: [push, pull_request]
jobs:
  e2e-tests:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: cd frontend && npm ci
      - name: Install Playwright browsers
        run: npx playwright install --with-deps
      - name: Start dev server
        run: npm run dev &
      - name: Wait for server
        run: npx wait-on http://localhost:3000
      - name: Run E2E tests
        run: npm run test:e2e
      - name: Upload test results
        if: always()
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: playwright-report
          path: playwright-report/
```

### Performance Considerations

**Test Execution Time:**
- Target: <10 minutes for full test suite
- Use parallel execution across 4 workers
- Cache Playwright browser installations in CI
- Skip redundant navigation between tests

**Test Reliability:**
- Use deterministic wait strategies (`page.waitForSelector`)
- Avoid hard-coded timeouts
- Retry flaky tests automatically (2 retries in CI)
- Screenshot failures for debugging
