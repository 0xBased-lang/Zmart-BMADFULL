## Technical Implementation

### Data Flow

```
User connects wallet
  ↓
useUserBets hook fetches bets from Supabase
  ↓
Categorizes into: Active, Pending, Claimable, History
  ↓
usePortfolioMetrics calculates all metrics
  ↓
Real-time WebSocket subscriptions for updates
  ↓
Components display with live updates
```

### Type System

**Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces:**
- `UserBet` - Active bet with live market data
- `PendingBet` - Bet on market pending resolution
- `ClaimablePayout` - Winnings ready to claim
- `BetHistoryItem` - Historical bet record
- `PortfolioMetrics` - Complete portfolio statistics (20+ fields)

### State Management

**useUserBets Hook:**
```typescript
- Fetches all bets for connected wallet
- Joins with markets table for current data
- Calculates current odds and values
- Categorizes by market status
- Sets up real-time subscriptions
- Returns: activeBets, pendingBets, claimablePayouts, betHistory
```

**usePortfolioMetrics Hook:**
```typescript
- Calculates 24+ portfolio metrics
- Handles null/undefined safely
- Memoized for performance
- Updates in real-time with bet changes
```

**useClaimPayouts Hook:**
```typescript
- Integrates with Solana/Anchor
- Fetches bet data from Supabase
- Constructs PDAs correctly
- Signs and submits transactions
- Updates database on success
- Comprehensive error handling
```

### Real-Time Features

**WebSocket Subscriptions:**
```typescript
supabase
  .channel('user_bets_changes')
  .on('postgres_changes', {
    event: '*',
    schema: 'public',
    table: 'user_bets',
    filter: `user_wallet=eq.${walletAddress}`
  }, () => refetch())
```

**Automatic Refetch Triggers:**

- 2-second grace period for connecting
- Wallet disconnection handling
- Missing env var checks

**Empty States:**
- No bets yet
- No active bets
- No pending resolutions

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Memoization:** All calculations memoized with useMemo
2. **Lazy Loading:** Components load only when needed
3. **Debouncing:** Refetch debounced to prevent excessive calls
4. **Caching:** Real-time subscriptions cache data client-side
5. **Code Splitting:** Dashboard page code-split from main bundle
6. **Optimized Queries:** Single query fetches all user bets with joins
7. **Minimal Re-renders:** State updates optimized with useCallback

---

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements

### Current Limitations

1. **No Bet History Tab:** Currently shows all-time stats, not paginated history
2. **No Filters:** Cannot filter bets by date range or outcome
3. **No Sorting in Pending:** Pending bets only sorted by end date
4. **No Export:** Cannot export bet history to CSV
5. **Placeholder Claim Logic:** Actual claiming needs full program integration

### Suggested Enhancements

1. **Advanced Filters:**
   - Date range picker
   - Outcome filter (wins/losses/pending)
   - Market category filter

2. **Enhanced Analytics:**
   - Performance charts (line graph)
   - P&L by time period
   - Best performing markets
   - ROI trend over time

3. **Activity Feed:**
   - Recent bet placements
   - Recent resolutions
   - Recent claims

4. **Notifications:**
   - Market resolution alerts
   - Claimable payout notifications
   - Bet performance alerts

5. **Export Features:**
   - CSV export of bet history
   - PDF reports
   - Tax documentation
