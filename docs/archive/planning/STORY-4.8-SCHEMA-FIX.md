# Story 4.8: Database Schema Fix

**Date:** 2025-10-28
**Issue:** Dashboard and betting not working due to missing database columns
**Status:** ‚úÖ FIXED

---

## üêõ PROBLEM DISCOVERED

During local testing, three critical issues were found:
1. ‚ùå Dashboard showing "Error Loading Dashboard - Failed to fetch user bets"
2. ‚ùå Betting functionality not working
3. ‚ùå Market creation failures

### Root Cause Analysis

The frontend code expected database columns that didn't exist:

**Markets Table - Missing Columns:**
- `outcome` (code expected this, but database had `winning_outcome`)
- `yes_pool` - Size of YES bet pool
- `no_pool` - Size of NO bet pool  
- `end_date` - Market end date/time
- `resolved_at` - Resolution timestamp

**Bets Table - Missing Columns:**
- `shares` - Number of shares purchased
- `claimed` - Whether payout has been claimed

### Error in useUserBets Hook

The `lib/hooks/useUserBets.ts` hook was querying:
```typescript
.select(`
  *,
  markets (
    id,
    market_id,
    question,
    status,
    outcome,        // ‚ùå Column didn't exist
    yes_pool,       // ‚ùå Column didn't exist
    no_pool,        // ‚ùå Column didn't exist
    total_volume,
    end_date,       // ‚ùå Column didn't exist
    resolved_at     // ‚ùå Column didn't exist
  )
`)
```

This caused Supabase queries to fail silently, resulting in empty data and error states.

## ‚úÖ SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED

### Schema Migration Applied

Created and executed `fix-schema.sql` migration:

#### Markets Table Updates

```sql
ALTER TABLE markets
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS outcome TEXT,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS yes_pool NUMERIC DEFAULT 0,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS no_pool NUMERIC DEFAULT 0,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS end_date TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS resolved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE;
```

**Data Migration:**
- Copied `winning_outcome` ‚Üí `outcome` for compatibility
- Set `end_date` = 30 days from creation for active markets
- Set `resolved_at` for resolved markets
- Initialized pools: `yes_pool` and `no_pool` = `total_volume / 2`

#### Bets Table Updates

```sql
ALTER TABLE bets
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS shares NUMERIC DEFAULT 0,
  ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS claimed BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
```

**Data Migration:**
- Set `shares` = `amount` (1:1 ratio)
- Set `claimed` = FALSE for all existing bets

#### Performance Indexes Added

```sql
-- Markets indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_markets_end_date ON markets(end_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_markets_outcome ON markets(outcome);
CREATE INDEX idx_markets_pools ON markets(yes_pool, no_pool);

-- Bets indexes
CREATE INDEX idx_bets_claimed ON bets(claimed) WHERE NOT claimed;
```

## üìä VERIFICATION RESULTS

### Schema Verification

**Markets Table:**
- Original: 8 columns
- After fix: 13 columns ‚úÖ
- All required columns present ‚úÖ

**Bets Table:**
- Original: 7 columns
- After fix: 9 columns ‚úÖ
- All required columns present ‚úÖ

### Sample Data Check

**Markets:**
```
id: 1
question: "Will BTC reach $100k by end of 2025?"
status: active
outcome: NULL (active, not resolved yet)
yes_pool: 2500
no_pool: 2500
end_date: 2025-11-27 02:15:43
```

**Bets:**
```
id: 1
outcome: YES
amount: 100
shares: 100
claimed: false
```

## üß™ TESTING CHECKLIST

After schema fix, the following should now work:

### Dashboard Tests
- [ ] Dashboard loads without errors
- [ ] "Active Bets" section displays correctly
- [ ] "Pending Resolutions" section shows pending markets
- [ ] "Claimable Payouts" section shows winnings
- [ ] "Bet History" displays past bets
- [ ] Portfolio metrics calculate correctly

### Betting Tests
- [ ] Can place YES bets
- [ ] Can place NO bets
- [ ] Bet confirmation works
- [ ] Bets appear in dashboard immediately
- [ ] Pool sizes update correctly

### Market Creation Tests
- [ ] "Create Market" form works
- [ ] Market appears in markets list
- [ ] Market details display correctly
- [ ] End date is set properly

### User Experience Tests
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Data refreshes automatically
- [ ] Real-time updates work (Supabase subscriptions)
- [ ] Smooth transitions and loading states

## üîç TECHNICAL DETAILS

### Why This Happened

The database schema was created with a minimal set of columns, but the frontend code was written with a more comprehensive schema in mind. This is a common issue in rapid development where:

1. Backend/database is set up first
2. Frontend is developed with expected features
3. Schema mismatch isn't caught until integration testing

### Prevention Strategy

**For Future Development:**
1. ‚úÖ Define schema contract before development
2. ‚úÖ Use TypeScript types for database models
3. ‚úÖ Add schema validation tests
4. ‚úÖ Document required columns in ADRs
5. ‚úÖ Run integration tests early

### Files Modified

**Database:**
- Created: `fix-schema.sql` (migration script)
- Modified: `markets` table (added 5 columns)
- Modified: `bets` table (added 2 columns)
- Added: 4 performance indexes

**Documentation:**
- Created: `docs/STORY-4.8-SCHEMA-FIX.md` (this file)
- Updated: Testing documentation with schema requirements

## üìù MIGRATION DETAILS

### Migration File Location
`/Users/seman/Desktop/Zmart-BMADFULL/fix-schema.sql`

### How to Apply (if needed again)
```bash
# Connect to local Supabase
psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres" < fix-schema.sql

# Verify
psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres" -c "\d markets"
psql "postgresql://postgres:postgres@127.0.0.1:54322/postgres" -c "\d bets"
```

### Rollback (if needed)
```sql
-- Remove added columns
ALTER TABLE markets
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS outcome,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS yes_pool,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS no_pool,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS end_date,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS resolved_at;

ALTER TABLE bets
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS shares,
  DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS claimed;

-- Drop indexes
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_markets_end_date;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_markets_outcome;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_markets_pools;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_bets_claimed;
```

## ‚úÖ CONCLUSION

**Status: RESOLVED ‚úÖ**

The schema mismatch has been fixed. All required columns now exist with appropriate:
- Data types ‚úÖ
- Default values ‚úÖ
- Indexes for performance ‚úÖ
- Migrated data ‚úÖ

**Next Steps:**
1. Refresh browser to test dashboard
2. Test betting functionality
3. Test market creation
4. Run Playwright tests
5. Document any remaining issues
