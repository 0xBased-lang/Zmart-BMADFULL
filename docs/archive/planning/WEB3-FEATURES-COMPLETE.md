## 📊 WHAT WAS IMPLEMENTED

### 1. ✅ Market Resolution Flow (Admin)

**Location:** `app/admin/components/ProposalManagement.tsx`

**Features:**
- Admin dashboard shows all active and resolved markets

- Real-time refresh capability

**User Flow:**
1. Admin opens `/admin` page
2. Views "Market Resolution" section showing all markets
3. When market ends, status shows "⏰ Ready"
4. Admin clicks "Resolve YES" or "Resolve NO"
5. Market resolves in database with resolution + timestamp
6. Users can now claim payouts

**Technical Implementation:**
- Database updates with resolution outcome and timestamp
- Status changes from 'active' to 'resolved'

## 🎯 COMPLETE MARKET LIFECYCLE

The full prediction market lifecycle now works end-to-end:

### Phase 1: Market Creation
- **Option A:** Admin creates market directly (`/admin/create-market`)
- **Option B:** User proposes → Community votes → Admin approves → Market created

### Phase 2: Betting
- Users view market on homepage
- Connect wallet (Phantom/Solflare on devnet)
- Place YES or NO bets
- Bets recorded on-chain and in database
- Real-time pool updates

### Phase 3: Resolution
- Market end time passes
- Admin views market in admin dashboard
- Admin resolves as YES or NO
- Resolution recorded with timestamp
- Winners can now claim

### Phase 4: Payout
- Winning users navigate to "My Bets"
- See claimable payouts with calculated amounts
- Click "Claim Payout"
- Solana transaction executes
- Funds transferred to wallet
- Bet marked as claimed

## 🧪 TESTING CHECKLIST

### Manual Testing (Playwright)

Run: `npx playwright test e2e/devnet-diagnostic.spec.ts --headed`

**What it tests:**
- ✅ Homepage loads with markets
- ✅ Market detail page accessible
- ✅ Betting panel renders
- ✅ YES/NO buttons appear (when wallet connected)
- ✅ Proposals page loads

### Manual User Testing

**Test Scenario: Complete Market Lifecycle**

1. **Setup:**
   - ✅ Dev server running (`npm run dev`)
   - ✅ Supabase running (`supabase status`)
   - ✅ Wallet on Devnet with SOL

2. **Test Flow:**
   - ✅ Create market via `/admin/create-market`
   - ✅ Place bet on market
   - ✅ Wait for/manually set market end time
   - ✅ Resolve market via admin dashboard
   - ✅ Claim payout via "My Bets"
   - ✅ Verify funds received

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - ✅ Bet on losing side → No payout
   - ✅ Claim payout twice → Error handling
   - ✅ Market not resolved → Can't claim
   - ✅ Disconnected wallet → Can't claim
