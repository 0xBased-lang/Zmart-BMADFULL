# üé≠ PLAYWRIGHT DEPLOYMENT ANALYSIS

**Test Date:** 2025-10-28
**Deployment URL:** https://frontend-d4l34ppgl-kektech1.vercel.app
**Test Tool:** Playwright (Automated Browser Testing)
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è ISSUE DETECTED

---

## üîç WHAT PLAYWRIGHT DISCOVERED

### Test Results Summary

```
‚úÖ Page Navigation: Successful
‚ùå Page Content: Shows Vercel Login Page (NOT your app!)
‚ùå Page Title: "Login ‚Äì Vercel"
‚ö†Ô∏è  Console Errors: 3 errors detected
‚ö†Ô∏è  Console Warnings: 2 warnings detected
```

### Critical Finding

**Your deployment is redirecting to Vercel's login page!**

This means the deployment is either:
1. Not publicly accessible (project is private)
2. Requires authentication to view
3. Has incorrect deployment settings

### Console Errors Detected

```
1. Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 ()
   ‚Üí 401 = Unauthorized (authentication required)

2. Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 403 ()
   ‚Üí 403 = Forbidden (access denied)

3. Provider's accounts list is empty.
   ‚Üí Related to authentication/wallet provider
```

### What This Means

‚ùå **Your app is NOT publicly accessible**
‚ùå **Users can't visit your deployment URL**
‚ùå **Environment variables won't matter until access is fixed**

---

## üõ†Ô∏è HOW TO FIX THIS

### STEP 1: Make Deployment Public (REQUIRED!)

#### Option A: Via Vercel Dashboard (Easiest)

1. **Go to Project Settings:**
   ```
   https://vercel.com/kektech1/frontend/settings
   ```

2. **Click "General" tab**

3. **Find "Deployment Protection" section**

4. **Change setting to:**
   - ‚úÖ **"Public"** (anyone can access)
   - OR ‚ùå Remove "Vercel Authentication" requirement

5. **Save changes**

6. **Test again:**
   ```bash
   # Visit in browser (should work now!)
   https://frontend-d4l34ppgl-kektech1.vercel.app
   ```

#### Option B: Via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Remove authentication requirement
vercel env rm VERCEL_AUTHENTICATION

# Redeploy
vercel --prod
```

### STEP 2: Configure Environment Variables (After Step 1)

Once the deployment is public, you need to configure environment variables.

**Required Variables:**

```bash
# Network Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_NETWORK=devnet
NEXT_PUBLIC_RPC_ENDPOINT=https://api.devnet.solana.com

# Program IDs (from docs/DEVNET-ADDRESSES.md)
NEXT_PUBLIC_CORE_MARKETS_ID=6BBZWsJZq23k2NX3YnENgXTEPhbVEHXYmPxmamN83eEV
NEXT_PUBLIC_PARAMETER_STORAGE_ID=J63ypBPAjWEMrwyFxWTP6vG8tGF58gH8w9G6yjDFqumD
NEXT_PUBLIC_BOND_MANAGER_ID=8XvCToLC42ZV4hw6PW5SEhqDpX3NfqvbAS2tNseG52Fx
NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKET_RESOLUTION_ID=Hcxxt6W1HmKQmnUvqpgzNEqVG611Yzt2i4DUvwvkLRf2
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROPOSAL_SYSTEM_ID=5XH5i8dypiB4Wwa7TkmU6dnk9SyUGqE92GiQMHypPekL
NEXT_PUBLIC_PROGRAM_REGISTRY_ID=2ysaGgXXKK7fTjKp59nVyivP7yoUpf9QHJqQHAuavchP

# Admin Wallet
NEXT_PUBLIC_ADMIN_WALLET=4MkybTASDtmzQnfUWztHmfgyHgBREw74eTKipVADqQLA
```

**Add via Vercel Dashboard:**
```
https://vercel.com/kektech1/frontend/settings/environment-variables
```

### STEP 3: Supabase Setup (Optional, for data features)

**If you want comments, user profiles, and data features:**

1. **Create Supabase Project:**
   - Go to https://supabase.com/
   - Click "New Project"
   - Get your project URL and anon key

2. **Add to Vercel:**
   ```bash
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project.supabase.co
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
   ```

**If you DON'T need these features:**
- Skip Supabase setup
- App will work without it (markets, betting, proposals)

### STEP 4: Redeploy

After configuring everything:

```bash
cd frontend
vercel --prod
```

### STEP 5: Test with Playwright

Run the automated test again to verify:

```bash
cd frontend
PLAYWRIGHT_TEST_BASE_URL=https://frontend-d4l34ppgl-kektech1.vercel.app npx playwright test
```

**Expected Result (after fixes):**
```
‚úÖ Page Title: Should show "Zmart" or your app name
‚úÖ No 401/403 errors
‚úÖ Wallet connect button visible
‚úÖ App content loads properly
```

## üìä WHAT PLAYWRIGHT TESTED

### Test: "Homepage Loads and Captures State"

**What it does:**
1. ‚úÖ Navigates to your deployment URL
2. ‚úÖ Waits for page to fully load
3. ‚úÖ Captures all console messages (errors, warnings, logs)
4. ‚úÖ Takes a full-page screenshot
5. ‚úÖ Checks for wallet connect button
6. ‚úÖ Analyzes page content for error indicators
7. ‚úÖ Reports detailed findings

**What we learned:**
- üî¥ Deployment requires authentication (blocking access)
- üî¥ Environment variables not the primary issue
- üü° Fix access first, then configure env vars

---

## üéØ CONFIGURATION PRIORITY ORDER

**Fix these in order:**

### 1. FIRST: Make Deployment Public ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL
```
Without this, nothing else matters!
```

**Action:**
- Change Vercel project settings to "Public"
- Remove authentication requirement
- Verify URL is accessible

**Test:**
```bash
# Should load without redirecting to login
open https://frontend-d4l34ppgl-kektech1.vercel.app
```

### 2. SECOND: Add Environment Variables üîß REQUIRED
```
Your app needs these to connect to Solana devnet
```

**Action:**
- Add all NEXT_PUBLIC_* variables
- Include program IDs from DEVNET-ADDRESSES.md
- Set for Production environment

**Test:**
```bash
# Should see no "configuration missing" errors
vercel env ls
```

### 3. THIRD: Configure Supabase üìä OPTIONAL
```
Only needed if you want data features (comments, profiles)
```

**Action:**
- Create Supabase project (if needed)
- Add URL and anon key to Vercel
- Or skip if not using data features

**Test:**
```bash
# Check if Supabase env vars are set
vercel env ls | grep SUPABASE
```

### 4. FOURTH: Redeploy üöÄ REQUIRED
```
Vercel needs to rebuild with new configuration
```

**Action:**
```bash
vercel --prod
```

**Test:**
```bash
# Run Playwright test
npx playwright test
```

### 5. FIFTH: Test Manually üéÆ RECOMMENDED
```
Automated tests are great, but manual testing is essential
```

**Action:**
- Open deployment URL in browser
- Connect wallet (on devnet)
- Try creating a market
- Try placing a bet
- Check all pages work

## üö® TROUBLESHOOTING

### Issue: "Still shows Vercel login"

**Solution:**
1. Clear browser cache
2. Try incognito/private browsing
3. Double-check project settings
4. Wait 1-2 minutes for settings to propagate
5. Run: `vercel --prod` to force redeploy

### Issue: "Page loads but shows errors"

**Solution:**
1. Check browser console (F12)
2. Verify all environment variables are set
3. Confirm program IDs are correct
4. Run: `vercel env ls` to list all vars
5. Check Vercel deployment logs: `vercel logs`

### Issue: "Wallet won't connect"

**Solution:**

2. Check program IDs in env vars
3. Verify RPC endpoint is set correctly
4. Try different wallet (Phantom vs Solflare)
5. Check browser console for specific errors

### Issue: "Playwright test fails"

**Solution:**
1. Ensure deployment is public first
2. Wait for env vars to propagate (2-3 min)
3. Run test with --headed to see browser: `npx playwright test --headed`
