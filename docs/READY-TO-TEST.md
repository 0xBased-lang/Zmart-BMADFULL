## 🐛 KNOWN LIMITATIONS (Devnet)

### Expected Behaviors
1. **Supabase Local Only:** Must run `supabase start` first
2. **No Market Data:** Fresh devnet = empty database
3. **Slow RPC:** Devnet RPC can be slow (30-60s confirmations)
4. **Rate Limiting:** Faucets may be rate-limited
5. **No Real Money:** This is testnet, SOL has no value

### Not Yet Implemented
1. **Market Creation UI:** Can create via proposals only
2. **Market Resolution UI:** Admin can resolve via proposals
3. **Full Admin Controls:** Basic admin panel only

## 🔍 DEBUGGING TIPS

### If Wallet Won't Connect
1. Check wallet is on devnet network
2. Try refreshing page
3. Check console for errors
4. Try different wallet (Phantom vs Solflare)

### If Transactions Fail
1. Check you have enough SOL (need ~0.01 for tx fees)
2. Wait for previous tx to confirm first
3. Check devnet RPC status
4. Look at transaction logs in console

### If Data Doesn't Load
1. Verify Supabase is running (port 54321)
2. Check .env.local configuration
3. Run sync scripts to populate data
4. Check browser console for API errors

### If Claim Button Doesn't Appear
1. Verify market is resolved (status = 'resolved')
2. Check you have bets on winning outcome
3. Ensure bets not already claimed
4. Look at console for query errors
