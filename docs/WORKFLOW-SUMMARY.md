## 💡 KEY PRINCIPLES

1. **Always Update the Tracker**
   - It's the source of truth
   - Keep it current
   - Review it at start of every session

2. **Use Automation**
   - Don't manually test if you can automate
   - Diagnostic tests save time
   - They provide evidence

3. **One Issue at a Time**
   - Don't context switch
   - Fix completely before moving on
   - Verify each fix works

4. **Document Everything**
   - Future you will thank you
   - Help others understand
   - Learn from past fixes
