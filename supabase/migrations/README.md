# Database Migrations

This directory contains SQL migration files for the BMAD-Zmart database schema.

## Running Migrations

### Local Development (Supabase CLI)

```bash
# Make sure Supabase is running
supabase start

# Run all pending migrations
supabase db push

# Or run a specific migration
supabase db execute --file supabase/migrations/003_leaderboard_views_and_indexes.sql
```

### Production (Supabase Dashboard)

1. Go to Supabase Dashboard â†’ SQL Editor
2. Copy the contents of the migration file
3. Execute the SQL
4. Verify views and indexes were created successfully

## Migration Files

- `003_leaderboard_views_and_indexes.sql` - Story 3.9: Leaderboard views and performance indexes

## Database Views

### user_stats
Aggregates user statistics for leaderboards:
- `activity_points` - User's total activity points
- `total_bets` - Count of all bets placed
- `win_rate` - Ratio of winning bets (0.0-1.0)
- `total_profit` - Sum of profit/loss across all bets
- `total_volume` - Total amount bet

### creator_stats
Aggregates market creation statistics:
- `markets_created` - Count of markets created
- `creator_total_volume` - Sum of volume across created markets
- `active_markets` - Count of currently active markets
- `resolved_markets` - Count of resolved markets

## Performance Indexes

Critical indexes for optimal query performance:
- `idx_users_activity_points` - For points leaderboard sorting
- `idx_bets_user_wallet` - For user profile queries
- `idx_markets_creator_wallet` - For creator profile queries

## Testing Queries

Test queries are included in each migration file to verify performance.
Expected query times:
- Leaderboard queries: <100ms (95th percentile)
- Profile queries: <50ms

## Troubleshooting

**Views not updating?**
Views are automatically updated when underlying tables change. No manual refresh needed.

**Slow queries?**
Check if indexes are being used: `EXPLAIN ANALYZE your_query;`

**Migration fails?**
Check if tables (`users`, `bets`, `markets`) exist first. These should be created by earlier migrations.
