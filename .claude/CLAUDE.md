## ðŸŽ¯ Claude Skills Integration

### blockchain-tool
**Purpose:** Comprehensive blockchain development and security toolkit

**Use Cases:**
- Smart contract security auditing (470+ vulnerability patterns)
- Solana/Anchor program debugging
- Oracle manipulation detection
- Flash loan attack prevention
- Wallet security analysis
- Economic attack analysis
- MEV exposure assessment
- Professional audit report generation

**When to Activate:**
- Before deploying any smart contract
- When security concerns arise
- For program optimization
- During contract architecture review

**Example Usage:**
```
"Use blockchain-tool to audit the betting contract"
"Analyze the market resolution program for vulnerabilities"
"Check for reentrancy risks in the core-markets program"
```

**Use Cases:**
- Next.js dApp frontend development
- Wallet integration (Phantom, Solflare, MetaMask)
- Transaction management and error handling
- Smart contract interaction (ethers.js/viem/wagmi/@solana/web3.js)
- E2E testing with Playwright
- Gas optimization
- Performance profiling
- Web3 debugging workflows

**When to Activate:**
- Building frontend features
- Debugging wallet connections
- Implementing transaction flows
- Optimizing dApp performance
- Testing Web3 integrations

**Example Usage:**
```
"Use web3 to debug the wallet connection issue"

## Project-Specific Workflow

### Smart Contract Development
1. Design program architecture
2. Implement with Anchor framework
3. **Use blockchain-tool for security audit**
4. Test on devnet
5. Deploy after audit passes

### Frontend Development
1. Design user interface
2. **Use web3 for wallet integration**
3. Implement transaction handling
4. Test with Playwright
5. Deploy to Vercel

### Code Review Process
1. Run CodeRabbit for automated review
2. **Use blockchain-tool for contract security**
3. **Use web3 for frontend/integration issues**
4. Address findings
5. Validate with tests

## Testing Strategy

### Smart Contract Testing
- **blockchain-tool:** Security and vulnerability testing
- Anchor test suite: Unit tests
- Integration tests: Multi-program flows

### Frontend Testing
- **web3:** E2E dApp testing with Playwright
- Unit tests: Component testing
- Integration tests: API + blockchain interaction

---

## Security Best Practices

### Always Use blockchain-tool For:
âœ… Pre-deployment contract audits
âœ… Security vulnerability scans
âœ… Economic attack analysis
âœ… Access control validation
âœ… Oracle manipulation checks

### Always Use web3 For:
âœ… Wallet security implementation
âœ… Transaction protection
âœ… XSS prevention in dApps
âœ… Proper error handling
âœ… Secure RPC provider usage

---

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Deploying Contracts:
- [ ] Run blockchain-tool security audit
- [ ] Address all critical/high findings
- [ ] Test on devnet extensively
- [ ] Document all program accounts
- [ ] Verify upgrade authority settings

### Before Deploying Frontend:
- [ ] Run web3 integration tests
- [ ] Test wallet connections
- [ ] Validate transaction flows
- [ ] Check error handling
- [ ] Run CodeRabbit review
- [ ] Deploy to preview environment first
